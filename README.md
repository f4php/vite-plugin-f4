# Vite plugin for f4

This is a Vite plugin for [f4](https://github.com/f4php/f4), a lightweight web development framework.

It provides support for running [Vite](https://vite.dev/) development server as an HMR-enabled proxy to php application written with F4, as well as for custom pug tags such as `vite:include` and `vite:bundle` to simplify integration between server-rendered pages and bundled vue/css/js resources.
